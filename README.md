Microproject2
This project is a simple CRUD application built using the MEN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. We used Express as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and define routes, making server management efficient and scalable. MongoDB was integrated using Mongoose, a library that provides an abstraction layer over MongoDB, enabling us to define schemas and enforce validation rules for the data being stored. Sensitive information, such as the MongoDB Atlas connection string, was securely stored using the dotenv package in an environment file (.env) to maintain security and flexibility.

The project followed a modular structure, with separate folders for routes, models, and configuration files, ensuring clean and maintainable code. The cors middleware was added to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing API requests from different domains. The project specifically implemented the Create operation (POST method) to add new documents to the MongoDB collection. This was tested using Postman, a tool that allowed us to send requests with JSON data to verify the API functionality. Mongoose schemas ensured that only valid and well-structured data was stored in the database.

The development process was made efficient by using Nodemon, which automatically restarted the server whenever code changes were detected. The project was version-controlled using Git and uploaded to GitHub, with a .gitignore file configured to exclude unnecessary files like the node_modules folder. A README.md file was included in the repository to provide documentation on the project setup, features, and usage instructions. This structure ensured a secure, scalable, and well-documented application.
